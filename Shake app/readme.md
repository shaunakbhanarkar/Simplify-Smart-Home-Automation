**Overview of Sensors in smartphones**

Today, smartphones come with a range of sensors that provide fairly precise as well as accurate results. Sensors form an integral part of the Android ecosystem,
given the fact that a large number of Android applications make use of the sensors in some or the other way. Sensors can be used in many interesting ways to create
amazing applications and provide additional functionality which otherwise could be difficult to implement.

Some of the most common sensors found in smartphones include Acclerometer, Magnetometer, Gyroscope, Camera, Proximity sensor, etc.

**Usage in the project**

We use two sensors, namely *Accelerometer and Magnetomer*, in the Shake app to determine the home device which needs to be operated.

The entire Android project along with code can be found in my respository named ShakeApp.
